### Learn how to write your own Blockchain with JavaScript.

I'll show you what is behind a blockchain by using simple code.

It's not a complete implementation, but enough to understand how blockchains
work and how they guarantee that blocks can never be changed.

After creating our blockchain we'll try and tamper with it.

This will demonstrate a blockchains ability to detect fraud.

Adding the proof-of-work mechanism to our homemade Javascript blockchain.

Proof-of-work will secure our blockchain against spammers and people trying to
tamper with our blocks.

### Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/bliotti/make-a-blockchain`
