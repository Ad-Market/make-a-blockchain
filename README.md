# Build a Blockchain from scratch (NodeJS).

### Learn
- What is behind a blockchain by using simple code. It's not a complete implementation, but enough to understand how blockchains work and how they guarantee that blocks can never be changed.

- After creating our blockchain we'll try and tamper with it. This will demonstrate a blockchains ability to detect fraud.

- Adding the proof-of-work mechanism to our homemade Javascript blockchain. Proof-of-work will secure our blockchain against spammers and people trying to tamper with our blocks.
